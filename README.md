# Purpose

In this repo, I have attempted to implement various classfication algorithms on the titanic dataset.

# Data
This dataset was sourced from the highly popular [Kaggle Spaceship Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic)

# Algorithms
1. Na√Øve Bayes
2. Logistic Regression
3. Linear Discriminant Analysis
4. Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
5. Decison Trees (CART)
6. Bagging
7. Random Forest
8. Boosting
9. K Nearest Neighbors

# Metrics 
1. Accuracy
2. Precison
3. Recall
4. F1 Score
5. Confusion Matrix
6. AUC ROC

# Future Work
1. Add Support Vector Classification
2. Report Log Loss Metric as well
